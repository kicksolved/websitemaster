1. Employees & customers brainstorm problems for a specific device category. Customers validate if a problem is fake [Kick] or real [Solve].<br>
2. Solutions are proposed and either Kicked or Pre-Ordered.<br>
3. If enough pre-order, the solution is made. Solutions are delivered via app stores on smart devices. App subscriptions can subsidize the device and allow for higher hardware margins and customer lock-in.<br>
Check out how to pre-order your own KickSolved platform...
