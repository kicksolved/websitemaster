Thank you for validating this solved your problem. In order for us to build the solution we need to 3,000 people to pre-order a yearly subscription for $10 in the next 7 days. This is a discount over the monthly $1 subscription because you get 2 months for free. We are currently at 2,653 so we are nearly there.
