Thank you for validating this solved your problem. In order for us to build the solution we need to 7,500 people to pre-order a yearly subscription for $3 in the next 15 days. This is a discount over the monthly $0.3 subscription because you get 2 months for free. We are currently at 6,653 so we are nearly there.
